I am proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Node.js, Java and Spring Boot. I graduated Baruch College with a degree in corporate communciation, an amalgam of marketing, public relations and workplace communication. Before becoming a software engineer, I worked briefly as a English foreign language teacher and then pivoted into software engineering as I enjoyed the mentorship of teaching, but longed to continue learning as a student myself. In addition to English, I am also fluent in Italian and speak French and Spanish conversationally.",
